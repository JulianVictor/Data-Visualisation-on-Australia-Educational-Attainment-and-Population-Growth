        Education is a crucial determinant of individual and societal progress.
        In Australia, educational attainment varies significantly across
        different states and territories. Understanding these variations and
        their trends over the years can provide valuable insights into the
        efficacy of educational policies and socioeconomic development. This
        project aims to analyze the educational attainment levels across
        Australian states by year to identify patterns, progress, and areas
        needing improvement. The motivation behind this project is to contribute
        to the ongoing efforts to enhance educational outcomes and to inform
        policymakers, educators, and researchers about the current state and
        trends in education across the country.

        The primary aim of this project is to comprehensively analyze and
        compare the percentage of educational attainment levels across different
        Australian states for a specified range of age over a specified period.
        By doing so, the project seeks to uncover trends, disparities, and
        factors influencing educational outcomes, ultimately providing
        actionable insights for policy development and educational reforms.
